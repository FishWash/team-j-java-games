# Team J Java Games: Tank Game & Galactic Mail
Jonathan Fox & Johnathan Lee

# Overview
These games were built in Java using the Swing framework. Classes that applied to both games were written abstractly to allow for shared use. This allowed us to reuse elements like the object movement, collision, vector logic, game clock, screen-drawing logic, controls, and others.
